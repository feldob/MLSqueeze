# MLSqueeze

MLSqueeze is a tool designed to identify a diversified set of boundary candidates for machine learning classifiers. This helps in better understanding the decision boundaries of classifiers, to support robust and effective testing and validation practice.

## Features
- Automated boundary identification for ML and other classifiers.
- Ensures well-diversified boundary candidates.
- Enhances the ability to judge classifier boundaries effectively.

Currently Missing:

- Handling if missing values
- handling of categorical inputs
- Visualization support

## Usage

TODO

The experiments from the original research paper using MLSqueeze can be found in the dedicated [MLSqueeze_sbft_2024](https://github.com/feldob/MLSqueeze_sbft_2024) repository.
